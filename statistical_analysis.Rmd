# Figure 1c - Spatial distribution of NTs

The counts of cells on various cell sections. 

```{r}
nt_counts_location_wt <- c("poles" = 75, "septal" = 16, "sides" = 9)
print(nt_counts_location_wt)
```

```{r}
sh1 <-  1 + nt_counts_location_wt["poles"]
sh2 <-  1 + nt_counts_location_wt["septal"] + nt_counts_location_wt["sides"]
posterior_poles <- qbeta(p = c(0.0005,0.9995), sh1,  sh2)
CI_poles <- paste(scales::percent(posterior_poles), collapse = ", ")

p_poles_lt50 <- pbeta(0.5, sh1, sh2)
```

Supposing the distribution of NTs over the surface of the cell is uniform, the 99.9% posterior CI for the proportion of the cell surface occupied by poles is (`r CI_poles`). Alternatively we have $p = `r p_poles_lt50`$ for the hypothesis of uniformity if poles cover < 50% of the cell surface (which they clearly do).

## Are there more dead cells in P-GLG than in GLG?

```{r}
fit_fig2_dead <- fig2_data %>% filter(type == "cells") %>% 
  select(-category, -alive) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = alive_string, values_from = count) %>%
  glm(cbind(Live, Dying) ~ condition * time, family = "binomial", data = .)

summary(fit_fig2_dead)
```

Yes. There are significantly more dead cells in the P-GLG (across both times) and at later time (across both conditions) - the `conditionP-GLG` and `time25` rows above. The interaction (`conditionP-GLG:time25`) is not significant so we can't be sure whether the number of dead cells increases faster over time in P-GLG or GLG.

## Does P-GLG show more total NTs than GLG?

```{r}
fig2_data_NT <- fig2_data %>% 
  select(-alive, -alive_string, -type) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = category, values_from = count) %>%
  mutate(total_cells = `live cells` + `dying cells`,
         total_NTs = `live cells NTs` + `dying cells NTs`)

fit_fig2_NT <- fig2_data_NT %>%
  glm(cbind(total_NTs, total_cells - total_NTs) ~ condition * time, family = "binomial", data = .)

summary(fit_fig2_NT)
```

Fitting the full model with interaction turns out to be problematic because for the GLG at t = 0 we only see 0 NTs and the model becomes not well identified. There are multiple alternative approaches, first we can simply add 1 cell with NT to all conditions (note that this should reduce the between group differences):

```{r}
fit_fig2_NT_p1 <- fig2_data_NT %>%
  glm(cbind(total_NTs + 1, total_cells - total_NTs + 1) ~ condition * time, family = "binomial", data = .)

summary(fit_fig2_NT_p1)
```

This leaves us with significant difference for the P-GLG condition. Alternatively, we can fit a fully Bayesian model with mild regularization using RStanArm.

```{r, message=FALSE, results = "hide"}
fit_fig2_NT_stan <- fig2_data_NT %>%
  rstanarm::stan_glm(cbind(total_NTs, total_cells - total_NTs) ~ condition * time, family = "binomial", data = ., 
                     prior_intercept = normal(0,10), prior = normal(0,5),
                     warmup = 1000, iter = 6000) # Large number of iterations to accurately sample tails of the distributions
```

```{r}
summary(fit_fig2_NT_stan, probs = c(0.005,0.025, 0.975,0.995))

```


In this scenario, the 99% posterior credible interval (from 0.5% to 99.5%) for `conditionP-GLG` excludes 0, which is similar to p < 0.01 in the frequentist context. Similarly for the effect of time, but as in the previous case, we don't get definitive answer whether the increase in NTs over time is different between the two conditions.

We can also look solely at the t=25 time point:

```{r}
fit_fig2_NT_25 <- fig2_data_NT %>%
  filter(time == "25") %>%
  glm(cbind(total_NTs, total_cells - total_NTs) ~ condition, family = "binomial", data = .)

summary(fit_fig2_NT_25)
```

Where the difference is very strong.

## Do dead cells produce more NTs in P-GLG than in GLG?


```{r}
fig2_data_NT_dead <-  fig2_data %>% filter(!alive) %>% 
  select(-category) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = count)

fit_fig2_NT_dead <- fig2_data_NT_dead  %>%
  glm(cbind(NTs, cells - NTs) ~ condition * time, family = "binomial", data = .)

summary(fit_fig2_NT_dead)
```

Here we have the same problem as in the previous case and need to regularize/fit smaller model. Starting with adding 1 NT to all conditions:

```{r}
fit_fig2_NT_dead_p1 <- fig2_data_NT_dead  %>%
  glm(cbind(NTs + 1, cells - NTs + 1) ~ condition * time, family = "binomial", data = .)

summary(fit_fig2_NT_dead_p1)
```

This is also inconclusive. So we'll look only at t = 25:

```{r}
fit_fig2_NT_dead_25 <- fig2_data_NT_dead  %>%
  filter(time == "25") %>% 
  glm(cbind(NTs, cells - NTs) ~ condition, family = "binomial", data = .)

summary(fit_fig2_NT_dead_25)
```

Even after this restriction, the data are not conclusive (p > 0.1). We therefore cannot be sure if dead cells produce NTs at higher _rate_ in the P-GLG condition than in the GLG condition. (We are not running the RStanArm model here as even if it contradicted the results here, it would not still lead to strong evidence for the statement).

## Summary

There is good evidence that there are more dead cells and more cells with NTs  in the P-GLG condition (p < 0.001 and p = 0.04 respectively), but it is not clear whether a single dead cell is more likely to have NTs in the P-GLGL condition.

# Figure S5 a,b - Frequency of NT formation in $\Delta sigD$

Recreate figures S5a,b to check if the data were loaded correctly.

```{r}
data_S5ab <- read_cell_count_data("Fig. S5_Primary data_OB.xlsx", sheet = "Fig S5 chart ab", prefix = "SigD ") %>%
  mutate(condition = "-SigD P-GLG")

plot_cell_count_data_alive(data_S5ab, NULL) + expand_limits(y = 1)
plot_cell_count_data_NTs(data_S5ab, facet_wrap(~alive_string)) + expand_limits(y = 0.1)
```


Is the the frequency of NT formation in Î”sigD (at 90 min)  lower than in wt (at 25 min)? (both at P-GLG)

```{r}
wt_sigD_data <- 
  rbind(data_S5ab, p_glg) %>%
  mutate(condition = factor(condition, levels = c("P-GLG","-SigD P-GLG"))) %>%
  filter(time != "0") %>%
  select(-alive, -alive_string, - type) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = category, values_from = count) %>%
  mutate(total_cells = `live cells` + `dying cells`,
         total_NTs = `live cells NTs` + `dying cells NTs`)

```


```{r}
wt_sigD_data %>% group_by(condition) %>% summarise(ratio_NT_all = sum(total_NTs) / sum(total_cells), ratio_NT_dead = sum(`dying cells NTs`) / sum(`dying cells`))
```

First, let's look at the proportion of NTs across all cells:

```{r}
fit_wt_sigD_NT <- wt_sigD_data %>%
  glm(cbind(total_NTs, total_cells) ~ condition, family = "binomial", data = .)

summary(fit_wt_sigD_NT)
```

Significantly lower rate in $\Delta sigD$

Now let's look at the proportion of NTs in dead cells only:

```{r}
fit_wt_sigD_NT_dead <- wt_sigD_data %>%
  glm(cbind(`dying cells NTs`, `dying cells`) ~ condition, family = "binomial", data = .)

summary(fit_wt_sigD_NT_dead)
```

If we look at the dead cells only, we also have significantly lower rate in $\Delta sigD$. To summarise, the frequency of NT formation in Î”sigD (at 90 min) appeared to be lower than in wt P-GLG (at 25 min) (all p < 0.001).

## Differences within the $\Delta sigD$ condition


```{r}
data_within_sigD <-  data_S5ab %>%
  select(-alive, -alive_string, - type) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = category, values_from = count)

fit_sigD_live_cells <- data_within_sigD %>% 
  glm(cbind(`live cells`, `dying cells` + `live cells`) ~ time, family = "binomial", data = .)

summary(fit_sigD_live_cells)
```

The proportion of live cells decreases significantly at t = 90 (p < 0.001).

There are no NTs from live cells, but we can look at NTs from dead cells. 

```{r}
fit_sigD_NTs_dead <- data_within_sigD %>%  
  glm(cbind(`dying cells NTs`, `dying cells`) ~ time, family = "binomial", data = .)

summary(fit_sigD_NTs_dead)
```

The proportion of NTs from dying cells at t=0 is lower than the proportion at t = 90, but the difference is not significant.


Finally, we can look at the difference in percentage of NTs between live and dead cells at t = 90. Similarly to previous fits where one condition is all zeroes, we add 1 to all counts to regularize.


```{r}
fit_sigD_NTs <- data_S5ab %>%
  filter(time == 90) %>%
  select(-alive_string, -time, -type) %>%
  mutate(category = str_remove(as.character(category), "live |dying ")) %>%
  mutate(count = count + 1) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = category, values_from = count) %>%
  glm(cbind(cells, `cells NTs`) ~ alive, data = ., family = "binomial")


summary(fit_sigD_NTs)
```

With this regularization we can say that dying cells produced signicantly more NTs than living cells (p = 0.03).

# Figure S5 d,e - Frequency of NT formation in $\Delta lytEF$

Now we will do the same analysis we did for $\Delta sigD$, but using data for $\Delta lytEF$. First, recreate figures S5d,e to check if the data were loaded correctly.

```{r}
data_S5de <- read_cell_count_data("Fig. S5_Primary data_OB.xlsx", sheet = "Fig S5 chart de", prefix = "LytEF ") %>% mutate(condition = "-lytEF P-GLG")

plot_cell_count_data_alive(data_S5de, NULL) + expand_limits(y = 1)
plot_cell_count_data_NTs(data_S5de, facet_wrap(~alive_string)) 
```


```{r}
wt_lytEF_data <- 
  rbind(data_S5de, p_glg) %>%
  mutate(condition = factor(condition, levels = c("P-GLG","-lytEF P-GLG"))) %>%
  filter(time != "0") %>%
  select(-alive, -alive_string, - type) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = category, values_from = count) %>%
  mutate(total_cells = `live cells` + `dying cells`,
         total_NTs = `live cells NTs` + `dying cells NTs`)

```


```{r}
wt_lytEF_data %>% group_by(condition) %>% summarise(ratio_NT_all = sum(total_NTs) / sum(total_cells), ratio_NT_dead = sum(`dying cells NTs`) / sum(`dying cells`))
```

First, let's look at the proportion of NTs across all cells:

```{r}
fit_wt_lytEF <- wt_lytEF_data %>%
  glm(cbind(total_NTs, total_cells) ~ condition, family = "binomial", data = .)

summary(fit_wt_lytEF)
```

Significantly lower rate in $\Delta lytEF$

Now let's look at the proportion of NTs in dead cells only:

```{r}
fit_wt_lytEF_NT_dead <- wt_lytEF_data %>%
  glm(cbind(`dying cells NTs`, `dying cells`) ~ condition, family = "binomial", data = .)

summary(fit_wt_lytEF_NT_dead)
```

If we look at the dead cells only, we also have significantly lower rate in $\Delta lytEF$. To summarise, the frequency of NT formation in Î”lytEF (at 90 min) appeared to be lower than in wt P-GLG (at 25 min) (all p < 0.001).


## Differences within the $\Delta lytEF$ condition


```{r}
data_within_lytEF <-  data_S5de %>%
  select(-alive, -alive_string, - type) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = category, values_from = count)

fit_lytEF_live_cells <- data_within_lytEF %>% 
  glm(cbind(`live cells`, `dying cells` + `live cells`) ~ time, family = "binomial", data = .)

summary(fit_lytEF_live_cells)
```

The proportion of live cells decreases significantly at t = 90 (p < 0.01).


There are very few NTs overall, and many conditions contain only zero, so we will once again add 1 to all conditions for regularization. First we look at NTs from dead cells. 

```{r}
fit_lytEF_NTs_dead <- data_within_lytEF %>%  
  mutate(`dying cells NTs` = `dying cells NTs` + 1) %>%
  glm(cbind(`dying cells NTs`, `dying cells`) ~ time, family = "binomial", data = .)

summary(fit_lytEF_NTs_dead)
```

The proportion of NTs from dying cells at t=0 is not significantly different from the proportion at t = 90.


Finally, we can look at the difference in percentage of NTs between live and dead cells at t = 90. 


```{r}
fit_lytEF_NTs <- data_S5de %>%
  filter(time == 90) %>%
  select(-alive_string, -time, -type) %>%
  mutate(category = str_remove(as.character(category), "live |dying ")) %>%
  mutate(count = count + 1) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = category, values_from = count) %>%
  glm(cbind(cells, `cells NTs`) ~ alive, data = ., family = "binomial")


summary(fit_lytEF_NTs)
```

With this regularization we can say that dying cells produced signicantly more NTs than living cells (p < 0.01).

# Figure 4b - DNase treatments

Loading the data and checking that I can reproduce the figures.

read_dnase_subset <- function(file, sheet, range, condition) {

fig4_data %>% filter(dnase == "baseline")  %>% ggplot(aes(x = condition, y = ratio_100)) + geom_point(color = "gray", position = position_jitter(width = 0.3)) + stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se) + scale_y_log10()

# fig4_data %>% filter(dnase == "baseline") %>%

All interesting pairwise comparisons are significant even after adjustments for multiple testing. The exceptions are:

- The Dnase+  conditions are not meaningfully different from each other
- The `-comK` condition is not meaningfully different from all the `dnase+` conditions

Otherwise all p < 0.001.

# Correlation between $comK$ expression and plasmid transfer

Replacing 0s in the transformation data for comK with 1/number of recipients to avoid taking the log of 0.

```{r}
data_cor <- data_fig4c %>% inner_join(fig4_data %>% filter(dnase == "baseline"), by = c("condition", "replicate")) %>%

The transfer was quantitatively correlated with the expression of the comK gene (Fig. 4c, p < 0.001, Pearson's correlation 95% CI = (`r round(cor_confint, 2)`)).

## Do Ampicillin treated cells produce less NTs than p-GLG? Lets look at total NTs first:

```{r}
#ampicilin_t_90 <- tibble(Replicate = "All", `live cells` = 0, `live cells NTs` = 0, `dying cells` = 614, `dying cells NTs` = 23, condition = "Ampicilin")
ampicilin_t_90 <- data_S8_12 %>% filter(time == "90", condition == "Amp500") %>% mutate(condition = "Ampicilin", Replicate = paste0(replicate, field)) %>% select(-field, -replicate, -time) 

p_glg_t_25 <- p_glg %>% filter(time == "25") %>%
  select(-alive, -time, -type, -alive_string) %>%
  mutate(condition = "P-GLG")



data_fig8 <- rbind(ampicilin_t_90, p_glg_t_25) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "category", values_from = "count") %>%
  mutate(condition = factor(condition, levels = c("P-GLG", "Ampicilin"))) %>%
  mutate(total_cells = `live cells` + `dying cells`,
         total_NTs = `live cells NTs` + `dying cells NTs`) 

fit_fig8_NT <- data_fig8 %>%
  glm(cbind(total_NTs, total_cells - total_NTs) ~ condition, family = "binomial", data = .)

summary(fit_fig8_NT)
```

Significant. And now NTs relative to dying cells.

```{r}
fit_fig8_NT_dead <- data_fig8 %>%
  glm(cbind(`dying cells NTs`, `dying cells` - `dying cells NTs`) ~ condition, family = "binomial", data = .)

summary(fit_fig8_NT_dead)
```

Also significant.

**Suggested wording for the paper:** "led to death of majority of the cells and induced NT formation from dead cells although not as frequently as the P-GLG method (Supplementary Data Fig. 7b, p < 0.001). "


## Do number of dead cells change over time?

Here, we treat time as continous, i.e. we test the overall _trend_ over time, not the difference between individual time points.

```{r}
data_s8_12_model <- data_S8_12 %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "category", values_from = "count") %>%
  mutate(total_cells = `live cells` + `dying cells`,
  total_NTs = `live cells NTs` + `dying cells NTs`,
  time_num = as.numeric(time) / 30)

```

First, let's look at the number of dead cells for each condition:

```{r}
for(condition_to_test in unique(data_s8_12_model$condition)) {
  cat("================================\n\n Condition :", condition_to_test, "\n================================\n\n")
  fit_s8_12_time_dead <- data_s8_12_model %>%
    filter(condition == condition_to_test) %>%
    glm(cbind(`dying cells`, total_cells) ~  time_num, family = "binomial", data = .)

  print(summary(fit_s8_12_time_dead))
}
```

We see significant changes in number of dead cells over time for all but the EmptyLB (no antibiotic) condition. The EmptyLB condition is consistent with no change, but we also cannot rule out even relatively big changes (e.g., comparable to those in Ampicilin condition).

## Do number of total NTs change over time

Now let's look at the number of total NTs. We don't test the EmptyLB (no antibiotic condition) as it has 0 NTs at all time points.

```{r}
for(condition_to_test in setdiff(unique(data_s8_12_model$condition), "Empty LB")) {
  cat("\n================================\n\n Condition :", condition_to_test, "\n================================\n\n")
  fit_s8_12_time_NT <- data_s8_12_model %>%
    filter(condition == condition_to_test) %>%
    glm(cbind(total_NTs, total_cells - total_NTs) ~ time_num, family = "binomial", data = .)
  
  print(summary(fit_s8_12_time_NT))
}
```

We see that the Cm and Rif fits are problematic due to large number of zeroes, so we reinvestigate the Cm condition with regularization by adding 1 to all cells and with RStanArm.

First with adding 1:

```{r}
fit_cm_time_NT_1 <- data_s8_12_model %>%
  filter(condition == "Cm5") %>%
  glm(cbind(total_NTs + 1, total_cells - total_NTs + 1) ~ time_num, family = "binomial", data = .)

summary(fit_cm_time_NT_1)
```

Then the same with RStanArm and weakly regularizing priors:

```{r, message =FALSE, results="hide"}
fit_cm_time_NT_stan <-  data_s8_12_model %>%
  filter(condition == "Cm5") %>%
  rstanarm::stan_glm(cbind(total_NTs, total_cells - total_NTs) ~ time_num, family = "binomial", data = ., 
                   prior_intercept = normal(0,10), prior = normal(0,5),
                   warmup = 1000, iter = 6000) # Large number of iterations to accurately sample tails of the distributions
```

```{r}
summary(fit_cm_time_NT_stan, probs = c(0.005,0.025, 0.975,0.995))
```


Now Rif First with adding 1:

```{r}
fit_Rif_time_NT_1 <- data_s8_12_model %>%
  filter(condition == "Rif") %>%
  glm(cbind(total_NTs + 1, total_cells - total_NTs + 1) ~ time_num, family = "binomial", data = .)

summary(fit_Rif_time_NT_1)
```

Then the same with RStanArm and weakly regularizing priors:

```{r, message =FALSE, results="hide"}
fit_rif_time_NT_stan <-  data_s8_12_model %>%
  filter(condition == "Rif") %>%
  rstanarm::stan_glm(cbind(total_NTs, total_cells - total_NTs) ~ time_num, family = "binomial", data = ., 
                   prior_intercept = normal(0,10), prior = normal(0,5),
                   warmup = 1000, iter = 6000) # Large number of iterations to accurately sample tails of the distributions
```

```{r}
summary(fit_rif_time_NT_stan, probs = c(0.005,0.025, 0.975,0.995))
```

Both regularized fits for Cm5 and Rif don't show significant change, but also cannot rule out non-negligible effect.


## Summary

The time trend of the number of dead cells is statistically significant for all antibiotic conditions (all p < 0.001). Time trend of the number of NTs is statistically significant only for Ampicilin (p < 0.001).

# Figure S8 - P-GLG vs. Ampicilin

```{r}
data_p_GLG_25 <- fig2_data_NT %>% filter(condition == "P-GLG", time == 25) %>% rename(replicate = Replicate) 
data_amp_30 <- data_s8_12_model %>% filter(condition == "Amp500", time == 30) %>% 
  mutate(replicate = paste0(replicate, "-", field)) %>% select(-field, -time_num)

fit_pglg_amp <- glm(cbind(`dying cells NTs`, `dying cells`) ~ condition, family = "binomial", data = rbind(data_p_GLG_25, data_amp_30))

summary(fit_pglg_amp)
```

After P-GLG treatment, more NTs are created from dying cells than in Ampicilin (p < 0.001).



# Figure S10 - Spatial distribution of NTs after Ampicilin treatment

Does the distribution of NTs differ between the wt and ampicilin-treated?

```{r}
nt_counts_location_ampicilin <- c("poles" = 0, "septal" = 6, "sides" = 16)
print(nt_counts_location_wt)
```

```{r}
chisq.test(rbind(nt_counts_location_wt, nt_counts_location_ampicilin), simulate.p.value = TRUE, B = 20000)
```

The distribution of NTs is notably different from that of wild type (p < 0.001).

    transformations = if_else(transformations == 0, 1, transformations),
    recipients_100 = recipients / 100, ratio = transformations / recipients, ratio_100 = transformations / recipients_100, condition = factor(condition, levels = c("Spc, Cm","MLS, Spc","MLS, Cm, Spc") ))

figS14_data %>% filter(dnase == "baseline")  %>% ggplot(aes(x = condition, y = ratio_100)) + geom_point(color = "gray", position = position_jitter(width = 0.3)) + stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se) + scale_y_log10()

```


```{r}
fit_figS14_all <- figS14_data %>%
  mutate() %>%
  lm(log(ratio_100) ~ condition * dnase, data = .)

TukeyHSD(aov(fit_figS14_all))
```

All the contrasts of `Spc, Cm` in the baseline (dnase-) condition against everything are significant.
